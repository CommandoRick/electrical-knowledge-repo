Megacorp’s culture is to diversify their knowledge base and keep an open mind for new projects.  The project will align with Megacorp’s by giving employees the opportunity to grow in their technical knowledge, leadership and teamwork. The proposed asset management system will be largely targeted to construction and mining companies. This leverages a customer base, most of whom, may already be Megacorp customers. The project stakeholders include Megacorp and construction company clientele.\\

With more than 70,000 construction companies listed in Australia, the potential market size is 3500 clients if 5\% penetration is assumed~\cite{RefI2}. Table~\ref{tab_competitors} below gives an overview of the features of the proposed product compared to the closest competitors. Several services and features of the proposed product will address deficiencies of the existing competitors and set Megacorp ahead of the competition.
